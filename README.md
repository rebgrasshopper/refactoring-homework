## Introduction

Horiseon is set up as a company that offers services to business looking to navigate the online world. Their HTML and CSS, however, has been somewhat unclear, overly wordy, and did not support accessibility.

## Updates ##

Refactored code for two primary purposes - clarifying/condensing source code and improving accessibility:
- implemented semantic HTML tags
- deleted unnecessary end tag
- condensed CSS attributes for objects with identical styling
- organized CSS to match flow of HTML
- input comments to make navigation files easier
- pulled CSS background image into a sourced HTML img
- added descriptive alt tags to every image
- checked with screen reading software to ensure that alt text flowed reasonably well and described the images accurately
