# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This is a homework project to refactor imprecise code. The goals are as follows:

Using the Develop folder as a starting point:
- Edit the HTML file to use semantic elements  
- Add alt tags to each of the image elements
- Verify that all links are working (including images)
- Refactor the CSS file to be more concise
- Edit the title element to something descriptive and concise.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Homework submissions will be graded on:
- If semantic HTML elements are used
- If the image elements have alt tags
- If the header usage goes down in size dependent on importance (ie sub-headers are smaller than the parent headers)
- If the CSS file is more concise than the previous version
- If the title of your webpage is concise and descriptive
- If all functionality of the webpage is working as intended
- If comments are found inside the HTML and CSS files

## Work Completed

The work I have completed is:
- provided an appropirate title for the webpage
- replaced appropriate div tags with more semantic tags such as section, article, header, footer, aside, nav, and figure
- replaced footer header with a lower importance header
- switched class "hero" image from a div background to an inline image for accessibility
- provided alt tags for each image
- double checked each image with a screen reader for flow and clarity
- checked display on different devices using chrome developer tools
- corrected non-working internal link on nav bar
- added commenting to files to improve readability
- collected repeated CSS text into single classes
- matched organization of CSS file to that of HTML
