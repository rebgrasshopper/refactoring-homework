## Introduction

Horiseon is set up as a company that would offer services to business looking to navigate the online world. Their HTML and CSS was, however, somewhat unclear, overly wordy, and did not support accessibility.

## Updates ##

To clean up the code I did the following:
- implemented semantic HTML tags
- deleted unnecessary end tag
- condensed CSS attributes for objects with identical styling
- organized CSS to match flow of HTML
- input comments to make navigation files easier

To improve accessibility I did the following:
- pulled CSS background image into a sourced HTML img
- added descriptive alt tags to every image
- checked with screen reading software to ensure that alt text flowed reasonably well and described the images accurately

## Usage ##

This website is a simple, one-page description of Horiseon's services and suggested benefits of those services. There are internal links in a top nav bar that will take you to each section of services.
